# Rick and Morty Dashboard

Simple React (19) and TypeScript project using Vite and Tailwind CSS 4.1. It fetches data from the Rick and Morty API using Axios and the latest React Router.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- `npm run dev` – starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – builds the app for production.

The dashboard shows cards of all episodes. Each episode and character has its own detail page.
Use the search bar in the header to find characters by name. Selecting a result will navigate to that character's dedicated page.
